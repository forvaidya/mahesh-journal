# Mini Project Plan: Key Technical Areas from Resume

This document outlines a structured plan for developing mini projects to reinforce and demonstrate proficiency in the core technical areas highlighted in your resume. The focus is on hands-on, achievable projects (each estimated at 4-8 hours) that align with your DevOps/SRE background, emphasizing practical application across programming, CI/CD, containerization, IaC, and networking. Projects are prioritized by relevance to your experience (e.g., Flipkart, Philips, TPVision) and designed for GitHub repositories, with built-in documentation for portfolio enhancement.

The plan includes 10 mini projects, grouped by theme, with objectives, tools/tech stack, deliverables, and success criteria. Aim to complete one per week, starting with foundational areas. Track progress in a central repo (e.g., `devops-mini-projects`).

## Project Prioritization
- **High Priority (Weeks 1-4)**: CI/CD and Containerization (core to your recent roles).
- **Medium Priority (Weeks 5-7)**: IaC and Networking (frequent in freelance/consultancy).
- **Exploratory (Weeks 8-10)**: Programming and Legacy Tools (to refresh polyglot skills).

## 1. Programming Languages and Scripting Mini Projects

### Project 1: Async Pod Monitor (Python Asyncio)
- **Objective**: Build a Python script using asyncio to monitor labeled Kubernetes pods across namespaces, simulating alerting for resource thresholds.
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.x, asyncio, kubernetes_asyncio client, logging module.
- **Deliverables**: Script with concurrent tasks for API polling; basic threshold-based console alerts; README with setup/run instructions.
- **Success Criteria**: Successfully polls 10+ pods concurrently without blocking; handles a simulated timeout exception gracefully.

### Project 2: Concurrent API Server (Golang)
- **Objective**: Create a simple HTTP server in Go that handles concurrent Fintech-style API requests (e.g., transaction validation) with goroutines and channels.
- **Tech Stack**: Go 1.21+, net/http, sync package, context for timeouts.
- **Deliverables**: Server binary with 3 endpoints; demo script for load testing; Go modules file and tests.
- **Success Criteria**: Processes 100 concurrent requests with <50ms latency; propagates errors via context cancellation.


## 2. CI/CD and Build Tools Mini Projects

### Project 4: Multi-Stage Pipeline Comparison
- **Objective**: Implement parallel CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps YAML and Jenkins for a sample microservice, focusing on Maven caching.
- **Tech Stack**: Azure DevOps/Jenkins, Maven 3.9+, cache plugins.
- **Deliverables**: Two YAML/declarative files; build artifact in a temp registry; comparison report in README.
- **Success Criteria**: Reduces build time by 30% with caching; deploys to a mock K8s environment.

### Project 5: Governance Enforcer Action
- **Objective**: Develop a custom GitHub Action for Terraform scanning with branch protection simulation, integrated with Slack notifications.
- **Tech Stack**: GitHub Actions, Terraform CLI, Slack webhook API.
- **Deliverables**: Action YAML and Docker image; test repo with protected branch demo.
- **Success Criteria**: Validates Terraform plan on PR; sends approval request to Slack if no errors.

### Project 6: NPM Hybrid App Pipeline
- **Objective**: Configure an Azure DevOps pipeline for a mock Android/iOS hybrid app build, including Snyk scans and parallel jobs.
- **Tech Stack**: Azure DevOps, NPM/Yarn, Snyk CLI, Azure Artifacts.
- **Deliverables**: YAML pipeline file; sample app repo; scan report artifact.
- **Success Criteria**: Runs lint/build/test in parallel; fails on high-severity vulnerabilities.


## 3. Containerization, IaC, and Cloud Mini Projects

### Project 8: Multi-Container Compose Setup
- **Objective**: Define Docker Compose for a Node.js/Python stack, with volumes and env overrides for dev/staging.
- **Tech Stack**: Docker Compose v2, Node.js, Python Flask.
- **Deliverables**: docker-compose.yml variants; sample services; startup script.
- **Success Criteria**: Launches stack with persistent data; switches envs without rebuild.

### Project 9: Terraform EKS Module
- **Objective**: Create a modular Terraform config for EKS with IRSA, remote state, and drift detection.
- **Tech Stack**: Terraform 1.6+, AWS provider, tfstate backend (S3).
- **Deliverables**: .tf files; apply/destroy scripts; drift check workflow.
- **Success Criteria**: Provisions cluster with 2 nodes; detects and reports config drift.


## Implementation Guidelines
- **Repository Structure**: One repo per project or monorepo with subfolders; include CI badge and demo video/GIF.
- **Testing**: Unit/integration tests for 80% coverage; manual verification on local/minikube setup.
- **Documentation**: Each project README with architecture diagram (e.g., Mermaid), setup steps, and lessons learned.
- **Timeline**: 10 weeks total; review bi-weekly for adjustments.
- **Resources**: Leverage free tiers (GitHub, AWS/GCP credits); track in a progress issue board.

This plan builds progressively, starting with familiar tools to gain momentum. Upon completion, these projects can form a strong portfolio showcase. If adjustments are needed (e.g., adding Rust or networking focus), let me know.
